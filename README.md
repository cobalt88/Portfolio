### Sumary

theres not a whole lot in here right now but that is changing rapidly. 

For now this will be a place to provide links to all of my currenly deployed personal projects and a few select group projects. As time goes ond I manage to complete and deploy more projects they will be added into this page. 

There are currently plans in place to build out separate pages for my person business Kiwi Dragon Creations LLc, a page ditcated to my woodworking and related services, as well as a page deticated twords my 3D printing/design services. 

The overall goal is to be able to have somewhere I can showcase my work to not just future employers, but also to clients who might be interested in my services.
