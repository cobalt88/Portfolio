      <p class="about">
        I am an Engineer, through and through. <br/>
        And by that I don't mean that I just make cool stuff and prefer the title of Engineer.<br/> 
        The way I think, the way I work, the way I approach almost everything, is as an Engineer, it is simply who I am. <br/>
        When I see something new, or at least new to me, my first thoughts are generally something along the lines of <br/>
        "How does that work? What is its function? Can I take it apart? Can I make it better? What if..." <br/>
        I have always had the mentality of wanting to understand a thing down to the most fundamental levels that I am capable of comprehending. <br/>
        Whether it be something mechanical, electrical, digital, or even theoretical, I just want to take it apart, <br/>
        learn from it, and incorporate its useful elements or lessons learned into my own future creations and designs. <br/>
        To be an Engineer is to always imagine what if, to always seek to understand the why and how of everything, and to never stop learning.<br/>
        That is the lens through which I view the universe.<br/>
        That is why I am an Engineer.</br>
        And that is why I dove head-first into the realm of Software Engineering.</br/>
