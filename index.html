    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <!-- image of the definition of an engineer including latin root translation -->
    <!-- about me section -->
      I am an Engineer, through and through. 
      And by that I don't mean that I just make cool stuff and prefer the title of Engineer. 
      The way I think, the way I work, the way I approach almost everything, is as an Engineer, it is simply who I am.
      When I see something new, or at least new to me, my first thoughts are generally something along the lines of "How does that work? What is its function? Can I take it apart? Can I make it better? What if..."
      I have always had the mentality of wanting to understand a thing down to the most fundamental levels that I am capable of comprehending. 
      Whether it be something mechanical, electrical, digital, or even theoretical, I just want to take it apart, 
      learn from it, and incorporate useful elements or lessons learned into my own future creations and designs.
      To be an Engineer is to always imagine what if, to always seek to understand the why and how of everything, and to never stop learning.<br/>
      That is the lens through which I view the universe.<br/>
      That is why I am an Engineer.</br>
      And that is why I dove head-first into the realm of Software Engineering.</br/>
